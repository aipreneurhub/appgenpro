Requirement: 
Create an interactive BI Dasboard that will answer the following questions for solar panels:
1. What is the energy output of the panel?
2. Are there instances of underperformance of the solar panel?
3. Why does the panel fail?
4. Can we predict when the panel will fail in the coming months? How frequently?
Data source is at: ~/Desktop/solar_sensors.csv

1) Real-time vs Batch: Currently, the data source is batch with daily updates. But, I want to build something that might be suitable for real-time processing / visualization. 

2) Criteria for performance evaluation:  comparing actual output versus expected output based on factors like panel efficiency, location, and weather conditions. 

3) For panel failures and frequency: categorize these failures (e.g., by cause, duration of downtime)
